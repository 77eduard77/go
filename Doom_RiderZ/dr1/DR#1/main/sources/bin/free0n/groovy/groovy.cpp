 * ++Groovy++
 * Groovy is the first Microsoft Office Groove worm. Groove
 * is a new Microsoft Office Tool that lets users share documents
 * and workspaces with other team members. Now the best part
 * about Groove is it "Automatically sends the changes you make 
 * in a workspace to your team members' computers." So naturally
 * this is now a new effective spreading technique that will
 * spread our worm for us and all we have to do is dump our file
 * into a workspace! omg how cool!
 *
 * Now there is some minor security on this tool so no .exe's but
 * we can do .zip's and .rar's so to fully exploit this little
 * loophole we make our worm have the ability to rar it'self! wow
 * hard stuff... the next little challenge is getting the 
 * the workspaces and path to them on the hard drive but once again
 * Microsoft made this really easy by creating us an XML file! 
 * so now we can just parse the xml file and get the all the 
 * paths to copy our worm. Then once the worm is copied to the folder
 * almost instantly Microsoft Groove will alert all the members 
 * of the workspace and download the worm to their computers.
 * Pretty cool right?!  
 * 
 * So let the fun begin on hacking this cool tool. This worm
 * is not violent with no destructive payloads and no real
 * defence against a.v. but since this is like a P.O.C. it 
 * shouldn't matter. I'm not out to destroy the world anyways
 * just the only p.c. that matters (mine) hehe :)
