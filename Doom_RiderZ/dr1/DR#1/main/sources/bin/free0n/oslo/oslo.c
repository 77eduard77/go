Oslo Virus by free0n [DoomRiderz] 3/28/2007 -
ipodlinux

Now you might say how might a virus spread from one ipod to the other? Well
how did computer viruses first spread? those big black things called floppies!
The way I look at it is the ipod is the new floppy. It's nothing but a big hard
drive. And People share programs just like they used to do and it doesn't take 
much more then posting the file on a message board or giving it to a friend and 
it may not be rapid spreading like other viruses/worms out there today but 
think about just how young these ipods actually are.. they are just in their
infancy...

How it works:
1. Oslo register's it'self in the /Extras/Demos/ menu section
2. Waits for a user to execute it
3. Upon execution the virus does a recurisve search in /usr/lib for all mod.so
   files.
4. For each potential file it checks to see if the file is ELF and it looks for
   a marker "Oslo" at the end of the file.
5. IF the file hasn't been infected it writes it's code to the top of the file
   then writes the host and then the marker.
6. After each file has been infected it then displays it's payload message
   and a cool graphic of the ipodlinux tux penguin

     We aren't totally mean as I didn't want to overwrite all the module

     the effect that happens is the same as what an overwriter would do.
     
     The reason why it's not a prepender/appender/poly is because of the way ipodlinux registers.
     applications in the main menu. Since our virus is registered as Oslo and we 
     can't dynamically change what the register name is and build a new module on 
     ipodlinux(on the ipod) we can't change what to register the module as during infection.

     Thus when it loops over the modules to build the main navigation it won't
     show every infected module but just one in each navigation sub section.
     So after infection the only modules that they will see are the ones that
     either aren't infected yet or if all modules are infected it will only show
