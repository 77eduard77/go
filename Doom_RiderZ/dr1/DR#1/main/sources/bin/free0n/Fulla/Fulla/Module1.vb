'1. Checks the registry and turns off Show File Extensions                  '
'   And Show Hidden Files                                                   '
'2. Infects files in the current directory by finding all                   '
'   exe files and prepending it's code to the host. There                   '
'   is ability for it'self to generate a temp file to launch                '
'   the original program after infection                                    '
'3. The most interesting part is that it downloads the source               '
'   code for genetix's Nurofen worm. Then compiles it and builds            ' 
'   an executable and executes the code! I've never seen this  before.      '
'   So what's the benefits? we can now upload anytype of file then have our '
'   program download and build the source code so we don't have to build    '
'   a downloader that just downloads an exe file and possibly get blocked.  '
'   file size is probably another benfit and updating say your trojan could '
'   be alot easier if you could just upload ur code changes and then have   '
'   your rat download and make a new build of itself all on the victim's    '
'   computer.
