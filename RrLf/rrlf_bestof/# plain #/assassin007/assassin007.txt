assassin007 wrote a 400 pages book called "Hackers’ Network Security Handbook". it used to be online at netsec.nnsol.com, but
the page is down. there are no articles by him here, cause all are part of the book. i got the whole book as pdf, but i didn't
want to violate his copyright, so i left the book (and parts of it) out of this zine. but when you're interested, drop me a mail,
perhaps i'll hand out the pdf.
