bat.ina was the first batch virus, able to update itself via the internet using ftp.
the url, from where it would download it's upate is still working. check out:
http://de.geocities.com/batina_rrlf/
of course the virus needs the password to log in to the ftp-account, so it's given in the code.
please don't be a lameass and "crack" the page. leave it as it is, for historical reasons. ty.
